# data-512-Wildfire-Analysis
## Wildland Fire Analysis of Rialto, California

## Project Overview  
The goal of this project is to study the wildfire data and analyse the factors that affect the smoke released into the atmosphere. Next step is to come up with a smoke estimate and see how closely they match with the Air Quality Index. Further, we model the available data to forecast the smoke estimate of the next 25 years.

Data pertaining to Wildland Fires, provided by the USGS, are publicly available and not subject to copyright restrictions.


AQI data is accessed through the EPA API.

### Code Attribution
Snippets of the code were taken from a code example developed by Dr. David W. McDonald for use in DATA 512, a course in the UW MS Data Science degree program. This code is provided under the Creative Commons CC-BY license.

## Access Key
To use AQI related API we need to request a key using a valid email address. The EPA then sends a confirmation email link and a 'key' that we use for all other requests. We only need to sign-up once, unless we want to invalidate the current key (by getting a new key) or we lose the key. Refer to the notebook 2_aqi_data_acquisition.ipynb for additional information.
